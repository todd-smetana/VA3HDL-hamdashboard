### Instructions
1. Just download the files from the Github repository (hamdash.html, config.js, and wheelzoom.js) and keep them together on the same folder.
2. Open hamdash.html with any browser of your preference and you done.
3. With any text editor (like Notepad) you can change the source images (can be more than one per box) or the menu options from the config.js file.

### Quick Help
* Double click on an image to expand to full screen.
* Double click again to close full screen view.
* Right click on an image to display the next one. (In the latest version is possible to add multiple images per box.)
* The content refreshes automatically every 5 minutes.

Is that easy!

## Updates
### 2024.05.27 Changelog:

- Moved the configuration parts of the JavaScript code to its own file "config.js" so it is easy to upgrade after updates to the main code. Suggested by Lou KI5FTY.
- Improved menu usability

### 2024.05.25 Changelog:

- Removed dependencies to local installed fonts. Fonts now are loaded from Google Fonts directly to ensure consistency.

- Autorefresh is now paused automatically when switching to a website (from menu) or when an image is zoomed-in to full screen
- Moved configuration variables to the top of the script and added extra commentary to ease the initial setup
- Added menu to the right of the page. Now the left menu has ham radio links and right menu has weather links
